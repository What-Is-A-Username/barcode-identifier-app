                <h5>Project Motivation</h5>
                <p>The Barcode Identifier Web App makes available a reference library of approximately 167 barcodes of Neotropical electric knifefish (order: Gymnotiformes) species first compiled by Janzen, Crampton and Lovejoy 2022.
                </p>

                    This web application, and the server on which it relies, was developed by Cheng Liang (William) Huang under the supervision of Nathan Lovejoy at the University of Toronto Scarborough. This web service was initially explored as a local standalone Tkinter application written by a past lab student, before the present software was developed for web.
